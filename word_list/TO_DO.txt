Maybe try Aaron's alphabet idea

By implementing these, I no longer need to store a list of all yellow and green letters
I can still print a list of black letters so the player can obviously see what not to use like in Wordle
Or I could not, lul

Try making a dict or tuple that stores the guess as well as if it's valid or not
